=== Google Gemini Option - Free with Limitations ===

During 2024, Vizaport is offering free access to Google Gemini without the need to obtain a key or pay for Gemini directly. By selecting this option, you understand that you will be limited to 10,000 chat requests per calendar month for free. Additionally, you acknowledge that free access may be revoked at any time and for any reason by Vizaport. Please note that the free option may also entail longer chat response times compared to other options, such as OpenAI.

If you choose the free Google Gemini option, you also consent to Vizaport storing the domain name of your website to track monthly chat requests and validate free access. If you do not agree to these terms for free access, you may opt for the OpenAI model and obtain your own key directly.

=== OpenAI Option - Your OpenAI Key ===

OpenAI is the platform behind ChatGPT. If you select this option as your AI model, you will need a key from OpenAI before proceeding, unless you have upgraded with Vizaport and have obtained a widget key instead. Go to <a href="https://www.openai.com" target="_blank">www.openai.com</a> to obtain the OpenAI key.

=== Usage of 3rd Party Service ===

This plugin utilizes a 3rd party service to provide AI answers to user questions to enhance chat functionality. If you choose the Google Gemini AI model, this plugin communicates with a service endpoint on the Google Cloud Platform that is managed by Vizaport, which communicates with Google Gemini. If you select the OpenAI model, this plugin communicates with the OpenAI API to generate chat completions, using an API key that you must acquire directly from OpenAI.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does your AI work? =

Our AI engine is built on Google Gemini and OpenAI (the platform for ChatGPT). By default, our AI engine can answer customer questions using public internet data. For increased accuracy, simply load documentation (e.g., pre-sales, operations, support) that your internal teams already use to answer questions. Vizaport will leverage your documents to train the AI engine to provide accurate answers. Note this requires an upgrade.

= What if I exceed the 10,000 chats per month with Google Gemini? =

Vizaport offers free use for Google Gemini during 2024, for up to 10,000 chats per month, pending availability of Vizaport's Gemini credits. If you exceed this limit, we suggest switching to OpenAI. Note you will need to acquire and pay for your own OpenAI API key.

= How do I install the widget on my web site? =

It's simple. After configuration, just click the Add Widget button in your Vizaport Settings.

= How do I train the AI for my products and services? =

First, please note that this requires an upgrade. Then, you will be guided through the steps to load documents and web pages to train the AI on your products and services.  You can upload various types of structured data (spreadsheets, XML) or unstructured data (documents, PDFs). There are step-by-step instructions to train the AI, preview your widget and then install on your web site.
